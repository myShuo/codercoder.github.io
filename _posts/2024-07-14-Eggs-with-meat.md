# Joy comes from curiosity
I often feel that joy comes from curiosity. A while ago, I chatted with my leader and mentioned that I have been exploring joy in my work and life as well.

As a type of operations and maintenance job, DBA has less interaction and more focus compared to pure development. Therefore, in order to avoid being swallowed up, it is necessary to explore various pleasures. 
For example, repeated stress tests and curiosity about the results; Curiosity about QPS/TPS; Even curiosity about fluctuations.

When I first started working with servers, I had to connect various network cables and switches in the computer room. Then, how did I configure servers from different manufacturers? Even when it came to mechanical disks, I had to stick them up to hear if there was any sound when the disks were running?
When learning RAID, remove a piece of disk to see if data is lost?
I am also surprised to learn how to transmit data through power lines!

Never treat learning as a goal, but as a process. Like having to eat every day, I might come across a farmhouse dish while eating today and practice replicating it at home on weekends.
Or when queuing up to order groceries and reading papers about a new version of MySQL released, then go and check out its features and how the MySQL worklog is written.

I am curious why it is necessary to update to a larger MySQL version, why it is not recommended to upgrade a certain version, and why eggs can be fried with meat.

# Curious why curious?
